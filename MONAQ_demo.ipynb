      "Cricket requires an umpire to signal different events in the game to a distant scorer/bookkeeper. \n",
      "The signals are communicated with motions of the hands. For example, No-Ball is signaled by touching each shoulder with the opposite hand, and TV-Replay, a request for an off-field review of the video of a play, is signaled by miming the outline of a TV screen. \n",

      "The dataset introduced consists of four umpires performing twelve signals, each with ten repetitions. \n",
      "The data, recorded at a frequency of 184Hz, was collected by placing accelerometers on the wrists of the umpires. Each accelerometer has three synchronous measures for three axes (X, Y and Z). \n",
      "Thus, we have a six-dimensional problem from the two accelerometers. 60% of the data is used for training and use the rest as testing data. The series are 1197 long.\n",

      "1. **Layer Sequence**:\n",
      "   - The use of **Conv1D**, **DepthwiseConv1D**, and **SeparableConv1D** layers ensures efficient feature extraction with reduced computational cost, which is crucial for edge devices.\n",
      "   - The **LSTM** layer captures temporal dependencies, which is important for time-series data.\n",
      "   - **Dense** layers with a softmax activation function are appropriate for multi-class classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dropout Rate**:\n",
      "   - A dropout rate of 0.2 helps prevent overfitting, especially important given the unbalanced dataset.\n",

      "3. **Pooling**:\n",
      "   - **Max pooling** reduces dimensionality and focuses on prominent features, aiding in computational efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Optimizer and Learning Rate**:\n",
      "   - The **Adam** optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 is effective for convergence.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Batch Size**:\n",
      "   - A batch size of 64 is a good compromise between memory usage and training speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Performance Metrics**:\n",
      "   - The expected accuracy of 85-90% meets the requirement for high classification performance.\n",
      "   - The model size is under 1 MB, and inference latency is estimated to be under 100 ms, making it suitable for real-time applications on edge devices.\n",
